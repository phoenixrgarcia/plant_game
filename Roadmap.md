# Content Brainstorming
### Garden thoughts
    Flowers are plants that don't generate a lot, but harvest for a lot
    Crops are plants that generate a lot, and harvest for little
    Trees are purchased infrequently, and provide lasting buffs

    Seeds come in tiers. Higher tiers seeds have higher chance of growing into higher tier plants

    Crops are split into vegetables and fruits (fungi?)
    Vegetables have consistent value
    Fruits have front loaded value

    Trees maybe don't have tiers, and instead just all have good effects you randomly get

### Mechanics thoughts
    Should this game have prestige mechanics?
    Prestige into random 'seasons' which buff certain plants
